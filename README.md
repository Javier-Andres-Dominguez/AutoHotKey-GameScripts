# AutoHotKey-Script
These are scripts that I do to learn AHK for educational and fun purpose. <br>
Instalation of AHK: https://www.autohotkey.com/ <br>
The main editor: https://www.autohotkey.com/scite4ahk/ <br>
There is also a folder named AHI, that is an implementation of the driver "Interception" for AHK. <br>
For more AHI information or the installation guide check https://github.com/evilC/AutoHotInterception
